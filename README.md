# What is does:  
This program takes weather input in Celsius and outputs icons of clothes you should wear for a run.



# Why I did it: 
To practice how to get user's input into JS program. I would also like to add a few checkboxes (rain, snow, sunny etc) and have a tool for myself, as I like to run.

# what-to-wear-for-a-run
Shows the outfit you should wear for a run.

# What is does:  
This program takes weather input in Celsius and outputs icons of clothes you should wear for a run.

# Why I did it: 
To practice how to get user's input into JS program. I would also like to add a few checkboxes (rain, snow, sunny etc) and have a tool for myself, as I like to run and sometimes it's difficult to decide if I need a hat or not.
